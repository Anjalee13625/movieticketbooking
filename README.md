# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System

## 📌 Project Description

The Movie Ticket Booking System is a desktop-based application developed using **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage movie listings, show schedules, and ticket bookings efficiently.

The application supports **role-based access** with separate functionalities for **Admin** and **Booking Clerk** users.  
Admins can manage movies and shows, while booking clerks can handle ticket reservations and cancellations.

The system ensures real-time seat availability tracking and provides a structured approach to managing movie ticket operations.
